6/22 BH: Received email on 6/22 that ticket has been assigned to a service technician GBL27140247i, however the PAST team still needs to know the location where this data is stored and needs to be provided access to this location
6/15: BH Since Kathy Zandi never responded we moved forward with using the record classifcation code R&D01-05 for the PAST request. Rick and Karen are both OK with this strategy as R&D01-05 has been used in situations similar to this.
6/8: BH we sent Kathy Zandi another note requesting that she submit the record classifcation codes and cc'd Karl Bratin, Rick Somes, and Karen Butler but still recieved no response. As a next step we plan to connect with the PAST team directly and assign the record classification code R&D001-005 which was the original code that was entered in the PAST request and furthermore was suggested by Karen Butler for data archival.
6/2: BH PAST request was submitted on 5/11, however Kathleen Zandi (business owner) wanted to confirm the record classification codes for this request with an analytical chemist on her team. She has been sent multiple email reminders but still has not submitted the codes so archival can't begin. We have escalated this issue to Rick Somes and Karen Butler.
5/11 New PAST request submitted as all instrument data will be archived together since it all resides on the shared drive
