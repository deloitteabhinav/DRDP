                     <p class="description font-s">Supports ongoing discovery, pre-clinical, and clinical studies research topics. These topics can be sourced from journal articles, industry reports, dissertation from leading research institutions, news release, and scientific technology brochures. Research topics help group information around particular scientific areas to give researchers access to detailed scientific material on a specific topic that can be used to further advance research. This provides researchers the ability to collaborate with their scientific peers on selected research topics and determine what publications are critical to meeting their R&amp;D objectives.
                     <br/>Research topics provides insight information on latest advances in all areas of Life Sciences to promote rapid communication and idea exchange amongst teams throughout your organization

                    <p class="description font-s">The choice of study type is a critical aspect of the design of medical studies to identify new therapies, drugs, and techniques. Study design, which covers planning, performance, documentation, analysis, and publication aspect of the study is also dependent on the study type which serves as an important determinant of selected studies quality and clinical value. 

When designing a study, please specify study category: <br/><br/>
(1) Basic Research - also known as experimental research that focuses on animal experiments, cell studies, biochemical, genetic, and physiological investigations on new drugs and therapies.<br/><br/>
(2) Clinical Research - includes experimental and observational studies on new drugs and therapies (i.e. Phase I - IV clinical studies).<br/><br/>
(3) Epidemiological research - investigation of the distribution and historical changes in disease frequency across various groups and geographies.</p>
